# Captcha-Refinement
The goal of this project is to develop an advanced model that improves the CAPTCHA verification process by effectively distinguishing between human users and automated bots during login attempts. The model aims to enhance security on login pages by analyzing user interactions and behavior to identify and mitigate bot activities.
